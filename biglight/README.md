## Test for BigLight

I had chosen ReactJS to create this test, I thought would be very good for performance, good pratice and to create a SPA.

# React Version
React 16.13.1

# CSS Processor used to create this App
SASS

In the Public folder you will find an assets folder and inside is the compass folder for the sass file.
You need to run sass with an npm command to run sass that will generate a css file to be possible ro run the website.

# Sass Install
1- Install Ruby == http://rubyinstaller.org/
2- Install Sass in your terminal:
2.1- 'gem install sass' or 'gem install compass', press return( ENTER ) to install
2.2- After the installation is completed, in your terminal:
2.2.1- Navigate till the folder where is the assets folder where you have the compass folder
2.2.2 - Run Sass in the Termional 'sass --watch compass:css'
3- This will generate a css folder to be possible to run the website.

# App Installation & Run the website
1- Clone or Download the repo to your local.
2- Throught your terminal navigate to the App folder and do 'npm install or npm i'
3- Run the App with 'npm start'
4- The will start running on 'http://localhost:4200' - The main door for React

# What's Inside?
The Web site has 3 pages, HomePage, PortfolioPage and AboutPage.
I'm injecting data in these 3 pages from the spreadsheet directly.

I had separated the spreadsheets one for each page. Go use just one I should create a Node server
That node server would generate a json file that would "feed" the whole process. The website would faster be then it is now.

My goal in this website was to be able inject data from a spreadsheet, like I was told to do, and I think I did it.
It's possible to do great things with this system. ( No Back Ends Needed )

I also, could create a javascript Injection to create the templates for each page for the spreadsheet data injection. ( Time was short ).

#Spreadsheets Injection

Home Page:

Portfolio Page:

About Page:

Why did I do it with 3 spreadsheets?
1- I wanted to see the behaviour of each page and also I tried to create a HTML template inside to fetch data from the spreadsheet.
2- I wanted to see waht I could do with the spreadsheets.
3- To get just one spreadsheet for the whole process you need a node server that generates a jason file ( time was short )
4- Was the first time I did something like this, usualy to do this with I use a Ajax Call or hooks with react to inject data that comes from the data base.

# Answer to your questions about GatsbyJS.
1- Can you explain what GatsbyJS is and what the benefits of using it are?
2- Can you explain how you would get the data from WordPress to GatsbyJS?
3- Can you describe why GatsbyJS makes a site secure?

Answer for these 3 questions:
I never worked with GatsbyJS before, I don't know about it, but the fact I don't know about it, doesn't mean I can't peak up and learn.
I just need peak it up and learn, is quick.

4- What is a PRPL?
Is a Google website structure that makes possible to build websites.

# Conclusion
I'm happy because I had reached the main goal that was to inject data in the website with a spreasheet, I did it.
There is a lot to improve in this matter and I would love to it.

Thank you for the opportunity.
