# Story
I'm still build this project, just a prototype.
I'm using for this project React and Jquery toguether, just to the behaviour combining both technologies.

This app is included a keypad.

But the goal is to remove jquery and build all components with Typescript.

Please, see it on mobile only: http://se7ven.jorgedd.com
After you load the app, you'll find a numeric keypad, pleaes type 7 numbers to go in.
